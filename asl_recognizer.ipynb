    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

You will derive a variety of feature sets (explored in Part 1), as well as implement three different model selection criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states for each word model (explored in Part 2). Finally, in Part 3 you will implement the recognizer and compare the effects the different combinations of feature sets and model selection criteria.  \n",

For example, we could normalize each speaker's range of motion with grouped statistics using [Pandas stats](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#api-dataframe-stats) functions and [pandas groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).

    "Now that we have built a training set with sequence data, we can \"train\" models for each word.  As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

In other words, you will write your own classes/functions in the `my_model_selectors.py` module and run them from this notebook:\n",

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

In the BIC equation, a penalty term penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting, so that it is not necessary to also use cross-validation in the selection process.  There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",

DIC scores the discriminant ability of a training set for one word against competing words.  Instead of a penalty term for complexity, it provides a penalty if model liklihoods for non-matching words are too similar to model likelihoods for the correct word in the word set."

    "**Answer 2:**\n",
    "These model selectors concentrate on different aspects of the model.  In SelectorCV, we train the model on one set of data and we are measuring the performance on unseen data. Therefore selectorCV measures how generalizable the model is, and prevents overfit. The disadvantage is that we don't have ability to split data in some of the models, because we don't have enough examples. In this respect the other two model selectors are more advantageous because we can train them on all data. \n",
    "The purpose of selectorBIC is to select the simplest model with the least amount of parameters without comprimising the performance. Therefore performance and complexity are two terms in BIC equation that work against each other. However in situations where more complex models are needed complexity term may actually be too penalizing.\n",
    "Finally selectorDIC focuses on the ability to classify the different states from each other. In the formula, we substract the average likelihood of the model for the other words from the likelihood for the current word. Therefore selectorBIC is a task oriented model selector. However, the biggest disadvantage I see is that we look at the average likelihood of the other models. selectorBIC may actually select a model that is not very good in differentiating between too very close models but on average gets a higher score because of the contribution by other word."

    "For the final project submission, students must implement a recognizer following guidance in the `my_recognizer.py` module.  Experiment with the four feature sets and the three model selection methods (that's 12 possible combinations). You can add and remove cells for experimentation or run the recognizers locally in some other way during your experiments, but retain the results for your discussion.  For submission, you will provide code cells of **only three** interesting combinations for your discussion (see questions below). At least one of these should produce a word error rate of less than 60%, i.e. WER < 0.60 . \n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer 3:** Aveages of 12 combinations of features and model selectors are shown below in a table. The best features were ground and polar, because they had the lowest average score with all three model selectors. Both delta and and norm were not very good. Apparently there is not much to be gained from normalization, this might be due to similar arm sizes and heights of ASL speakers in the videos. Delta was not very good also, probably because how the arm moved relative to nose were more important than movement with respect to initial position. The most surprising result for me was that Polar_norm was also worse than polar, apparently we do loose a lot of information in polar when we are normalizing.\n",
    "Overall, model selectors had also very close performance levels. Probably some model selectors do work better than others in some words, but when we train so many words, average result tends to be very similar. I have also tried to optimize selector_DIC by average the likelihood of 3 highest words instead of all word but this did not really help.\n",
    "Overall we need to take into account the language structure in order to better predict the word. For example some word may be more common than other therefore we need to bias our recognition toward those words.\n",

    "We've squeezed just about as much as we can out of the model and still only get about 50% of the words right! Surely we can do better than that.  Probability to the rescue again in the form of [statistical language models (SLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model).  The basic idea is that each word has some probability of occurrence within the set, and some probability that it is adjacent to specific other words. We can use that additional information to make better choices.\n",
